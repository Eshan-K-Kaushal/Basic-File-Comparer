# Basic-File-Comparer
These sets of codes would help one to compare the contents of their text files:
Either the matching words or the matching sentences, depending upon the code one uses. 
I will still upload new and updted codes, and tweak the existing ones since they still are not perfect. 
Any changes that would ameliorate the codes are welcome, once they ve have decided after consulting me!
NOTE- The Docx codes would work only for the DOCX files and not for DOC so please keep that thing in mind while uding them. 
Stay tuned for updates!
